# So.... Since I have gender working, I figure,wouldn't it be great if I could isolate what kind of screen im looking
#  at? I mean, if the boat misses a click, it suddently desyncs everythin. If I teach it to recognize certain
# screens, I can wait for loading screens, and for the main menu to be done... This seems like such a bad idea. But I
#  can't think of a reason to not do it.
